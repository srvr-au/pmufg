  <h1>Port Macquarie Urban Food Garden</h1>
  <p>Port Macquarie Urban Food Garden is a not-for-profit research and education organisation. Our research and education is based on sustainable food production for the grower. We have experience growing food on 40 acres and a suburban home block. We have been growing food with a sustainability goal since 1994. We initially started in Gympie on 40 acres. We turned 40 acres of Blady grass into a showcase of sustainability. We won the first Gympie Landcare Environment Award. After 5 years we had to move to a coastal urban environment (due to allergies to grass pollen) and continue our sustainability focus in an urban environment.</p>

<p></p>What is an Urban Food Garden? We were looking for a description of what we do and decided Urban Food Garden best describes it.
<br><b>- Urban.</b> We have a normal suburban backyard. We have a limited garden size.
<br><b>- Food.</b> We aim to grow a wide variety of food and in sufficient quantities to fulfill our everyday requirements. This is impossible but the challenge is to get as close as possible. 
<br><b>- Garden.</b> We grow for ourselves, not for others. So we are not a farm.</p>

<p>We have many years experience growing food with a sustainable goal both on a country property and a suburban block. We hope that what we have to say may be of some interest and benefit to you. Take what works for you and ignore the rest.</p>

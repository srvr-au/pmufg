  <h1>Where To Start?</h1>
  <p>A courier dropped a parcel off and said to us "This is what I want to do, how long did it take?". Wow, what a hard question to answer. You can bang up a professional looking food garden in just a few hours. Having the knowledge to make it work into the future is a whole different ball game. Many people banged up a garden for covid. Not many got anything out of it for any length of time. The knowledge required to grow a wide variety of food for a substantial length of time, can take many many years to learn. We've been doing sustainable food production since 1994, and we are still learning.</p>
  <h3>The Starting Point</h3>
  <p>Firstly you have to figure out what to plant. You'll need a space the size of a single bed to keep you in greens for a year. Greens are a good place to start as they aren't bothered by too many bugs. If you have a flat garden space then you don't need to worry about wood surrounds. Just scrape that grass off and dig it all up with a spade. Put in a bag of chicken manure and a few bags of compost, then dig it over again. Cos lettuce seedlings are the best bang for your buck, spinach and silverbeet are great too. Plant a third of your bed and mulch it. Water and you are done. In 3 or 4 weeks plant another third. The exact time between plantings depends on how fast the seedlings grow. In summer they grow faster so maybe 2 weeks, in winter slower so maybe 5 weeks.</p>
  <p>As you can see it's pretty easy to get a pretty slick vegy garden with just a couple of hours work. Now you just have to keep up the momentum for the long term.</p>
  <p>Once you get the hang of it you can dig up more ground and grow some other easy vegies. Carrots, beetroots, peas and beans are all easy. Get the hang of growing these year round and then keep expanding.</p>
  <p>It's nowhere near as easy as it sounds. The more balls you juggle the harder it gets to keep going. It's a start and if you love it, you won't be able to stop.</p>

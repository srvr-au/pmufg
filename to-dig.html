  <h1>To Dig Or Not To Dig</h1>
  <p>There are a lot of people out there who will tell you some form of no-dig gardening is the best. They all have different reasons for believing this.</p>
  <p>Some worship 'structure' and believe the soil reaches an equilibrium that should not be disturbed. Others believe if it doesn't happen in nature then you shouldn't do it either. Loosely based on the principle that nature is perfect, which in turn derives from the incorrect 'survival of the fittest' theory. Nature is not perfect, it is simply random. This results in something that works well at the time. Nature also has many dirt-diggers such as pigs and birds. This is recognised in permaculture through their pig and chicken tractors. If you can use a pig or chicken to dig the ground you might as well use a spade.</p>
  <p>Go to any patch of earth and disturb it. In a couple of weeks it will be filled with weeds. These weeds are annuals just the same as vegies. If you want to grow good crops of vegies you need to dig the soil. If you are going to dig you might as well dig in some compost. By digging the soil you introduce large amounts of oxygen and cause any organic matter to quickly decompose. This leads to an explosion of life and a quick drop in nitrogen. You may notice your seedlings yellow. It's always a good idea after digging and enriching the soil to let it rest for a couple of weeks before planting.</p>
  <p>Double digging is an excellent way to start. Simply put you remove one spade depth of soil and dig down a second spade depth. If you add compost to both levels this will give you 50cm of enriched soil. Soils in Australia are generally poor, so enriching deeply and frequently is a must.</p>

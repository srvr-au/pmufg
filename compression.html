  <h1>Compression Is Bad</h1>
  <p>Compression is the number one enemy of your soil. The wheel is the number one cause of compression. At one time people believed that hoofed animals cause compression. The wheel is much worse. The wheel literally grinds the soil molecules together. A hoof, however, simply compresses in a mosaic pattern. Let's look at some examples.</p>
  <p>When we bought our 40 acres the previous owners just drove their cars up to the back door. The back yard was like concrete, it didn't absorb water easily and the grass hardly grew. We improved things substantially because we had a lighter car and parked it at the front in a designated place, allowing the back yard to slowly recover. When driving the car in the paddocks we drove in as little as possible and always used the same track and parking space. Our paddocks, even in the biggest downpour, didn't shed water.</p>
  <p>On acreage once the grass gets too long the animals wont eat it, so you need to mow the long stuff. We bought a ride-on mower and just mowed the long clumps when they got too big. The ride-on mower was much lighter than a tractor, thus less compression. Occasionally we did need to hire a contractor to mow, when all the grass grew quicker than it could be eaten.</p>
  <p>In the USA a guy sold some river acres off. He was very surprised when the new owner grew lucerne on it as he had never been able to as the ground was too wet (from compression). The farmer told him he ploughed it with horses, that loosened the ground up, allowed air in and drainage to occur. The first guy always ploughed with a tractor.</p>
  <p>One part of our land had been used as a yard for poddy calves. We dismantled it and got a tractor in to rip it. We then ploughed it with horses and planted corn. Once the corn had got some height you could see the tracks where the trucks had driven in, the corn was much shorter. However you couldn't tell where the yard had been.</p>
  <p>In an urban environment use paths and don't walk on the garden beds, especially when they are wet. If I need to walk on the bed I throw a large plank down and walk on that. The plank spreads the load. After using the plank I break up the surface by raking. Wide pavers can be great to make paths too.</p>
  <p>Nothing could be stupider than washing your car on the grass, wet soil and wheels are a terrible combination.</p>

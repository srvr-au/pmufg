  <h1>Food Garden Layout</h1>
  <p>Laying out your garden correctly can see you produce more food. If you haven't bought a house and yard yet then the orientation is very important. In the southern hemisphere you should buy a place that faces north. This allows you to get maximum sunshine even when the sun is low in winter. North should also face a road, if it faces a neighbour you could lose all sunshine in winter if they grow trees. Be aware how much shade your house will caste. A two story house may completely shade your back yard.</p>
  <p>We purchased a north facing the road, 2 storey, house inset into a hill. Being inset the back yard is only a single story, we lose about 3 meters of growing area in winter.</p>
  <p>You will be growing your tallest trees on the south and west boudaries. On the south boundary they won't cast shadows on your garden. On the west boundary they will provide some respite from the sun on summer afternoons. On the east you can grow small trees so they don't not cast shadows when the early morning sun is needed in winter. Deciduous trees can be handy. North boundary should not have any trees as they will shade your garden in winter. Most efficient use of your land is to plant trees round the boundaries of your property and plant garden beds in the middle.</p>
  <p>Get land that is as flat as possible. If it is flat you won't have to build terraces and garden beds, saving you time and money. If it is sloping, a north facing slope is best. Avoid a southern slope.</p>

  <h1>Saving Your Seeds</h1>
  <p>To get your garden going you can buy seedlings, buy seed or plant your own seed. We find that buying seedlings can be the worst option. Often the seedlings have been forced and will often bolt very quickly. Buying seeds means the plants may not have adapted to your climate. If you live in North Queensland buying seeds from Tasmania may result in  plants that don't tolerate heat all that well.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately saving your own seed means you need a bigger garden, as the plants will be in the ground that much longer.</p>
  <p>People often say, not to try and grow seed from the supermarket, because they might be sterile and if F1 hybrid won't grow true. I grow several vegies sought from the supermarket and the seed grows true enough for my purposes. Besides once grown on it's no longer F1 hybrid, but becomes a selection. Grow it for a few years to get the seed growing true and you have a brand new plant to offer to the world. Nothing is more fun that selecting a plant that has superior qualities to grow on and form your very own selection. That's how all the heirloom varieties came about, they are all selections.</p>
